# Hotel Booking Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description

The Hotel Booking Analysis project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about hotel bookings. This analysis aims to uncover insights and trends related to customer preferences, booking patterns, and factors affecting hotel occupancy rates. The findings from this project can aid hotel management in decision-making processes and strategy formulation for improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- To analyze the patterns and trends in hotel bookings.
- To identify key factors influencing customer choices and booking decisions.
- To provide visual insights that can assist in strategic planning and marketing efforts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations that complements Pandas.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project contains hotel booking data with the following key features:

- **Hotel**: The type of hotel (City Hotel or Resort Hotel).
- **Lead Time**: The number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.
- **Number of Adults**: The number of adults in the booking.
- **Number of Children**: The number of children in the booking.
- **Number of Nights**: The duration of the stay in nights.
- **Booking Status**: Whether the booking was canceled or not.

## Key Steps and Methods

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing data using imputation and removal strategies.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Used appropriate encoding techniques to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to capture additional insights, such as total guests and stay duration.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted visualizations (bar plots, pie charts, and histograms) to identify trends and relationships among features.
- Investigated booking patterns, customer demographics, and factors influencing booking cancellations.
- Analyzed seasonal trends and the impact of lead time on booking status.

## Instructions to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekbarua56/Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA-
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA-
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook (EDA_on_Hotel_Booking_Analysis__(1).ipynb) in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order.

## Usage Examples

The following code snippet demonstrates how to load the dataset and visualize the booking status:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('hotel_bookings.csv')

# Visualize the booking status
sns.countplot(data=data, x='is_canceled')
plt.title('Booking Status Distribution')
plt.show()
```

## Results

The analysis revealed several key insights, including:

- The proportion of bookings that were canceled vs. confirmed.
- Patterns related to lead time and its effect on cancellations.
- Seasonal trends that could inform marketing strategies.

Visualizations and detailed findings are provided throughout the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements

- Conduct a more in-depth statistical analysis to validate findings.
- Implement predictive modeling to forecast future booking trends.
- Explore customer segmentation to better target marketing efforts.
